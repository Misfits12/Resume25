            <p>Hi, I’m Rob, a 32-year-old technology enthusiast currently pursuing a degree in Network Security. My career journey has been far from traditional. I started by earning a Culinary Arts certification from Harper College and spent a decade working in the food industry.
            At the same time, I’ve been with The Home Depot for 10 years, where I’ve grown and developed a passion for technology. Now, I’m redirecting that passion into the world of asset protection and cybersecurity. </p>
            <p> Outside of work and school, I enjoy diving into a variety of hobbies. Whether I’m playing PC games, working on cars, or simply exploring new ways to create and learn, 
            I’m always seeking something fresh to challenge my mind. I’ve been collecting comic books since childhood and have built up an impressive collection over the years. Music plays an important role in my life too, vinyl records are a key part of my downtime, and I love growing that collection.
            And as a dedicated Vikings fan, Sundays are reserved for cheering on my team.</p>
            <p>I’m always striving to expand my skill set, both in my professional and personal life. I’m excited to see where this path in tech and cybersecurity will take me. If you’re interested in learning more about the projects I’ve worked on or the current work I"m involved with, check out my testimonials! </p>
